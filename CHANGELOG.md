# Changelog

All notable changes to `filament-localization` will be documented in this file.

## v2.1.2 - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **Table actions on resources** — Resources now detect and localize Filament table actions beyond generic `Action::make()`, including `EditAction::make()`, `DeleteAction::make()`, `CreateAction::make()`, `BulkAction`, `RestoreAction`, `ForceDeleteAction`, and other common action types. Unnamed `::make()` calls (Filament v5 style) are supported.
- **Table filters on resources** — Filter label detection now uses the correct component class (`SelectFilter`, `TernaryFilter`, `TrashedFilter`, etc.) instead of a generic `Filter::make()` pattern, so filters with existing labels are handled correctly and missing labels are added reliably.
- **Separate table schema files** — Actions and filters defined in dedicated table schema classes (e.g. `UserTable::configure()`) are now analyzed, translated, and modified alongside columns.

### Enhanced

- **Widget localization** — Widget analyzer and modifier now detect and localize widget headings (`$heading` property, `getHeading()`), stat descriptions, and additional widget text via `->heading()`, `->title()`, and related helpers.

## v2.1.1 - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Resource localization** — Infolist body scanning, navigation group keys (`UnitEnum|string`), and `getNavigationGroup()` wrapping.
- **Relation manager localization** — Table empty state, KeyValue labels, action modal copy, `CreateAction::make()` without name, and literal `->label()` handling.
- **Page titles** — Inject `getTitle()` with `__()` when still using the Filament base implementation.
- **Discovery** — Namespaced `RelationManager::class` resolution in `filament:localize`.
- **Tests** — Coverage for `ResourceAnalyzer` and `RelationManagerAnalyzer`.

## v2.1.0 - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Laravel 13** — Composer allows `laravel/framework: ^12.0|^13.0`.

### Changed

- **PHP** — Requirement restored to `^8.3` (from `^8.2` in v2.0.1) to align with Laravel 13's minimum PHP version.
- **CI** — GitHub Actions matrix tests Laravel 12 and 13 with Orchestra Testbench 10 and 11.
- **Dev dependencies** — Pest 4.x, Testbench `^10.0|^11.0`.

### Compatibility

- **Supported**: PHP ^8.3–^8.5, Laravel ^12.0 | ^13.0, Filament ^5.0, Livewire ^4.0.
- **Note**: Laravel 12 on PHP 8.2 is not supported in v2.1.x; use [v2.0.1](https://github.com/MominAlZaraa/filament-localization/releases/tag/v2.0.1) if you need PHP 8.2 on Laravel 12 only.

## v2.0.1 - 2026-01-31

### Changed

- **PHP support** — Composer requirement relaxed from `^8.3|^8.4|^8.5` to `^8.2` so the package can be used on PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 (e.g. servers on 8.4 until 8.5 is available).


## v2.0.0 - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **PHP 8.5** — Composer allows PHP `^8.3|^8.4|^8.5`. v2.x supports PHP 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 only.
- **Filament 5 & Livewire 4** — Full compatibility with Filament v5.x (Livewire v4.x, Tailwind v4.x). All analyzers and modifiers work with Filament 5's structure (Forms, Tables, Infolists, Actions, Schemas).
- **README** — Version support table; "Supported" and "Deprecated" lines aligned with filament-team-guard style.

### Changed (Breaking)

- **Filament** — Requirement `^4.0` → `^5.0`. v2.x is Filament 5 only; use [v1.x](https://github.com/MominAlZaraa/filament-localization/releases) for Filament 4.
- **PHP** — Requirement `^8.2|^8.3|^8.4` → `^8.3|^8.4|^8.5`. PHP 8.2 is no longer supported in v2.x.
- **CI** — GitHub Actions test matrix updated to PHP 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 (8.2 removed).

### Compatibility

- **Supported**: PHP ^8.3–^8.5, Laravel ^12.0, Filament ^5.0, Livewire ^4.0.
- **Deprecated (use v1.x)**: PHP &lt;8.3, Filament v4, Livewire v3.
